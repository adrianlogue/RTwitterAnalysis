## R Twitter Analysis for Golf (or any subject really)

The initial concept for this model borrows heavily from the work of Micah Woods (https://github.com/micahwoods/turf_twitter_2017). While Micah's work was focused on "Turf Twitter" I'm more interested in broader golf twitter and other other specific segments of golf twitter such as golf course architecture, or golf journalism, or golf equipment.

Also I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn R and to be able to modify Micah's rationale and ask and answer different types of questions for myself.


### RATIONALE

This application is created to analyse "golf twitter", but simply changing the seed accounts would allow it to be applied to pretty much any field.

The "seed" accounts need to be carefully considered. It's probably the hardest thing about this endevour.

### USE

I don't see this ever being more than just a loose collection of files that contain a bunch of semi-organised snippets of R that you might use to selectively execute and create datasets then play with those datasets until you're satisified you've massaged it into something you can feed into the chart plotting code. All very ad-hoc.
